# CaDoodle
A free and open source CAD package using drag-and-drop shapes. 

# Inspiration

The workflow of Tinkercad is an excellent experence for novice users of CAD. 

1. Drag and drop shape
2. Group and ungroup
3. Solid and Hole status
4. Undo of operations
5. Stretch and move handles
6. Library of examples
7. Nearest Surface snappping


This workflow suffers from a few fundemental problems

1. Web based UI means it is enclosed by whomever runs the server
2. Subscription model is percarious (Autodesk is not known as a reliable partner for free tools over time)
3. Propriatary source files

# Solution 

This application is Java based and used BowerStudio as the CAD kernel.
